# Vara Project

This repository contains a full-stack application with separate front-end and back-end directories. The front-end is built using React and includes visualization capabilities via Chart.js. The back-end is built on Express and integrates with Google APIs.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install dependencies for both the front-end and back-end.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IvorZhu331/Full-Stack-Project.git
cd full-stack-project
```

### Install Front-End Dependencies

```bash
cd front-end
npm install
```

### Installing Back-End Dependencies

```bash
cd back-end
npm install
```

## Usage

This project uses `concurrently` to run both the front-end and back-end servers with a single command. To start both servers:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the front-end React application on `localhost:3000` and the back-end Express server on `localhost:3001`.
